    <h1>What is GPT?</h1>
    <p>GPT stands for "Generative Pre-trained Transformer". It is a type of artificial intelligence model that uses deep learning techniques to generate human-like text.</p>
    
    <h2>How does GPT work?</h2>
    <p>GPT is based on a type of neural network called a transformer. This allows it to process and generate text in a more natural way than previous models.</p>
    <p>It is pre-trained on massive amounts of text data, which enables it to learn the patterns and structures of language. Then, it can generate new text based on a given prompt or context.</p>
    
    <h2>What are some applications of GPT?</h2>
    <p>GPT can be used for a variety of natural language processing tasks, such as language translation, question answering, and chatbots. It can also be used to generate creative writing, such as poetry or short stories.</p>
    
    <h2>Example of GPT-generated text</h2>
    <p>Here is an example of text generated by GPT:</p>
    <blockquote>
      "Winter is coming," said Jon Snow. "And with it, the white walkers."
    </blockquote>
    <p>This line is from the popular television show and book series, Game of Thrones, which has inspired many GPT-generated texts.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>GPT is a powerful tool for natural language processing and text generation. As its capabilities continue to improve, it has the potential to revolutionize the way we communicate and interact with machines.</p>
